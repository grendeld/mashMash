    <div id="matrixText">There are works she creates with her breath, blowing articles of paint by mouth across the canvas. She describes “… molding lagoons of water with my breath into stalactite shapes that blend and dilute the explosions of paint.”* As she explains further, “Some become minimalist stains that comment more on the whiteness of the paper and others completely consume the white to leave a tantric tapestry that reminds me of sub-marine seascapes.”* Her travels in Andalusia inspire bright, vivid imagery in combination with drawings, photographs, woodcuts, etchings and various special effects. Of these processes Nowinska states, “My artworks tell a story which each spectator can develop from his/her own impressions. It begins to create a surreal world, incites a revolt in logic and transports them to other dimensions. They are visions of parallel universes, although quite fantastic, that comment on our cycles of life and death in a symbolic language.”* She communicates in a style that is both classic and synchronistic, patterns yoked in rhythm and movement, and no line gratuitous. Each piece creates a mood and prompts a memory or association. Opulent contours and fine details compel us to discover multiple points of clarity within intricacy and complexity. Many pieces incorporate human elements stripped to their anatomically exact skeletal forms that are combined into native components and vistas. Humanity and nature blend flawlessly. It allows for reconciliation within both the quixotic and quotidian that instills a harmonious solace within us. Flow and movement are defined precisely despite many images being of miniscule proportions. There is inherent rhythm in these pieces that is singularly recognizable yet integrative. Themes might repeat but bring new textures, patterns and values. There is a timeless quality and visual stability at work, an instinctive coordinated balance anchoring us to each piece. The style is distinctive and recognizable with focused intensity yet expansive vision.</div>
